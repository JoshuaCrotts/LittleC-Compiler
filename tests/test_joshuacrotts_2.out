Length of 'Hi there.': 9
Concatenating on '.. and welcome to the universe!' to the buffer: 
Hi there...and welcome to the universe!
Let's test some 2D array stuff.
Populating 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns:
1234
5678
9101112
... okay, now that that's over, let's do some arithmetic: 
5
-2
5
3
5
5
-1
8
1
... now let's sort some arrays! We'll use three sorting algorithms:
Quick sort:
-19
-7
-3
-1
0
5
13
13
101
1042

Selection sort:
-19
-7
-3
-1
0
5
13
13
101
1042

Insertion sort:
-19
-7
-3
-1
0
5
13
13
101
1042

Bubble sort:
-19
-7
-3
-1
0
5
13
13
101
1042
... if your code works, then all three outputs should be the same.
Finally, let's do some binary searches:
9
3
4
-1
-1
